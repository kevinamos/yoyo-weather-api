The API Service provides a simple API to fetch weather data

The goal of this `README` is to:
1. Establish a common language to be used by engineers, product managers, and customer success 
2. Walk engineers through local setup without needing help from others


## Common Language

This section establishes ubiquitous language that is accross all stakeholders.  
This language should be usable by both engineers in code and also other stakeholders.  

Min_temp:  
Minimum temperature.  

Max_temp:  
Maximum temperature.  

## Developer Guide

### Local setup
Install Pipenv locally (Or your preferred virtualization library.)
Pipenv install


### System inputs and outputs


###System outputs to external services
- We make HTTP calls to https://www.weatherapi.com/ for all our weather information.

### Software architecture
  - To be added. 
#### Software structure requirements

Conform to the existing layered structure, and use the entities, statics, and repositories in the same manner as existing code.
